# swordslash
In Swordslash you can swing your sword in 8 different directions (up, down, right, left, up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) and each monster has to be slashed in a different direction depending on its art, more details on this mechanic will become available on the next big update with an interactive tutorial.
